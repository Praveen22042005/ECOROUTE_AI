## ECOROUTE AI

## Problem:
Logistics operations today are hindered by several critical challenges. Inefficient route planning leads to excessive fuel consumption, delays, and higher transportation costs. Unpredictable traffic patterns further aggravate delivery disruptions, increasing operational expenses and lowering customer satisfaction. Resource underutilization due to poor vehicle capacity management contributes to waste and inefficiencies, while inaccurate demand forecasting causes stock imbalances, resulting in costly overstocking or stockouts. Additionally, the logistics industry contributes significantly to carbon emissions, yet lacks scalable, sustainable practices. Fragmented logistics data across multiple platforms makes it difficult to generate actionable insights, adding to the complexity of managing supply chains.

## Solution:
Our AI-powered logistics optimization platform tackles these challenges by leveraging advanced algorithms and real-time data to dynamically optimize supply chain routes.
